# METCS777 - Final Project

## Describe here your project


The dataset used in this project is the TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset downloaded from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata). It consists of 5000 different movies with 20 columns. For the purpose of this project, only 8 columns are used.

The goal of this project is to do some exploratory data analysis first to extract some insights from the data then build Machine Learning models that should be able to evaluate a movie’s success. A movie’s success is evaluated by Average Rating and Profit (Revenue – Budget). 




# How to run  

To run this project, you will need to download the movies CSV file from the link below and use it as first input argument. No other arguments are required to run this project.

I have also added the file to the project repository for ease of use.

The code and results can be found in the METCS777 - Final Project.py file.
